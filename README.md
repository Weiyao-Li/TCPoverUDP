# TCPoverUDP

This project involves implementing a simplified TCP over UDP using a link emulator to simulate network impairments. The objective is to create a sender (client) and receiver (server) transport-level code with a three-way handshake, error logging, and FIN request for ending transmission. The TCP header format is implemented without options, and the checksum is calculated over the header and data. The goal is to test the implementation using the link emulator and verifying correct data transmission.
